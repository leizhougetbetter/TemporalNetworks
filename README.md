# TemporalNetworks

The two folders contain the simulation code for empirical (folder Simu_EmpiricalNetwork) and synthetic networks (folder Simu_SyntheticNetwork), which are designed to generate the simulation results in the papaer titled *Evolution of Cooperation on Temporal Networks*. Detailed description of each simulation program can be found in the Readme.txt file in the corresponding folder.
