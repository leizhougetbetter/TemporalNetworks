README for MC simulation code
---------------------------------



DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is Monte Carlo simulation code for results in ER random network.
Running the original code, results in Figure 3a (g=100, static) can be obtained.
Changing p and g in function main() of the code, other results in Figure 3a can be obtained.

FILES
-----

    main.cpp      generate temporal network, static network, and provide frequencies of cooperation       


INSTALLATION
------------


    *) build a project 
    *) add main.cpp to the project
    *) compile and run
